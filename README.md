silho
=====

##How the hell this is going to work.
Engi will be used for rendering. Engine will be split up into modular "systems", each abstracted as to not depend on the other.
There will be these systems:

* Rendering (using said engi)
* Update
* Input
* Scripting system
* **Possibly** Networking

##What is this?
A game called silho (from silhoette). Its a topdown action/story game, where you progress through randomly generated buildings (or sectors) in order to find out information. Currently you only have one character option.

##But what is actually being built
The most basic, rudimentary version of silho. This is the feature list:

* One level
* 5 rooms
* Basic infiltration and combat system

The 5 rooms are randomly generated.

##What needs to be done?
*Everything*. But heres a pretty little list to make it less intimidating

* Engine with system compatibility
* Render system
* Update system
* Input system
* Scripting system
